# A Distributed Version Control 

systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. Also, in the event of corruption of a central database’s hard disk — with the absence of backups — all work will be lost, except for any portions on local machines.

* I learned about git, and some commands:
1. ls
2. cd
3. cd ..
4. touch
5. pwd
