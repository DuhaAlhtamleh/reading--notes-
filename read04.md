**HTML5** introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.

you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

I learned the about html the below:

* Headers & Footers
* Navigation
* Articles
* Article
* Forms
